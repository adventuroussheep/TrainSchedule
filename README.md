# TrainSchedule

This project uses Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Moment.js, the Bart API, and Firebase. 
The goal was to create a train scheduler from user input and calculate the time until the next trains arrival.
It also uses Barts API to list a handful of train schedules.
The data is stored in Firebase and can be deleted from Firebase simply by clicking delete.
